Firebase Assignment - Train Scheduler 

Overview
In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.


Setup
We'll leave that up to you -- however you like. Just make sure you're using Firebase to store data, GitHub to backup your project, and GitHub Pages to host your finished site.

Instructions
Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:
When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
Train Name
Destination
First Train Time -- in military time
Frequency -- in minutes
Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!

How I Solved This Assignment & My Technical Approach
I started out by creating a wireframe and general outline of where I wanted specific information to be pushed to. From there, I outlined how I would solve each step that needed to be completed. As I wrote the code, I took an iterative approach and solved problems as they arose, until the problem "fell off" the project. Once the code was functional, I finalized the CSS.
